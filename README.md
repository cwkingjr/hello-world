## Learning React with create-react-app

This app works through a series of four articles on "Learning React with create-react-app."

The articles are linked to in Issues 1-4. There is a pull request for each article, which can be found under 'commits.' Peruse these to see what code changed during each article.

In addition, the ending code for each article is tagged as a release under 'releases.' Article 1 is release v0.1, article 2 is v0.2, etc. You can download the code under releases, or, via the links below:

[v0.1](https://github.com/cwkingjr/hello-world/archive/v0.1.zip)
[v0.2](https://github.com/cwkingjr/hello-world/archive/v0.2.zip)
[v0.3](https://github.com/cwkingjr/hello-world/archive/v0.3.zip)
[v0.4](https://github.com/cwkingjr/hello-world/archive/v0.4.zip)

To run the code, create a react app structure using create-react-app as listed in [article 1](https://github.com/cwkingjr/hello-world/issues/1), download the code for your desired article into your hello-world directory, then, at a terminal:

    cd hello-world
    yarn install
    yarn start
    
This will start up the local server and open your browser to the localhost version of the application.

For article 4:

    cd hello-world
    yarn install
    yarn test

The test results will display in your terminal.
