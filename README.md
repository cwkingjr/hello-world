## Learning React with create-react-app

This app works through a series of four articles on "Learning React with create-react-app."

The articles are linked to in Issues 1-4. There is a pull request for each article, which can be found under 'commits.' In addition, the ending code for each article is provided as a release under 'releases.' Article 1 is release v0.1, article 2 is v0.2, etc.

To run the code, create a react app using create-react-app as listed in article 1, download the src code from here for the desired article into your src directory, then:

    cd hello-world
    yarn start

This will start up the local server and open your browser to the localhost version of the application.
